✨  About Me

I am a Full Stack Developer with 8+ years of experience in developing enterprise applications and open-source software.

My Opensource Story
All of my projects are released as open-source on GitHub, this includes some of my GitHub trending projects:

Nothing Private - This project is a proof of concept that any website can identify and track you, even if you are using private browsing or incognito mode in your web browser. It has around 1000K+ users and 1.8K+ stars. It got discussed in many privacy forums and conferences worldwide. Various privacy-focused browser vendors were able to implement fixes to prevent fingerprinting due to this project. It also made lots of people aware of the bad effects of browser fingerprinting.
Blog Post Workflow - A Github action to show your latest blog posts from any sources or StackOverflow activity or Youtube Videos on your GitHub profile/project readme automatically using the RSS feed. It is now used by over 5.6K+ users and running on thousands of GitHub actions runner every hour. It is also one of the top 20 most used GitHub actions internationally in GitHub Marketplace.
SoCLI scored 300+ stars within 24 hours of its release. It now has almost 2K+ users. It provides an easy way of accessing StackOverflow even if you are hooked into a terminal.
Motrix WebExtension - A browser extension for the Motrix Download Manager. It now has more than 10K+ users worldwide.

Most of my leisure time is to contribute to open-source projects on GitHub. Acknowledging my extensive contribution to DuckDuckGo's open source projects, I was promoted as a maintainer and community leader with write access to all DuckDuckGo's repositories. I had contributed to Mozilla, Angular, Svelte, Node.JS, and several other open-source projects and organizations.

I also maintain and contribute to a lot of community open-source projects and libraries. Some of the communities includes Tinkerhub Foundation, Kites Foundation, Mozilla Foundation, Patternfly etc. I strongly believe that the true value of open-source is not just the code, it's the community around it.

You can learn more about me and my open source journey at my website: https://www.gautamkrishnar.com/

Most of the open-source projects I create are the solutions to the problems I face in my life, there are even more that are yet unsolved. I am on a journey to find solutions for them, one at a time.
